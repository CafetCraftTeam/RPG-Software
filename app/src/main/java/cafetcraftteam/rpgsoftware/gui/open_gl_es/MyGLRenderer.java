     * Textures are an example of a resource that you might want to create
     * here.
     * <p/>
     * Note that when the EGL context is lost, all OpenGL resources associated
     * with that context will be automatically deleted. You do not need to call
     * the corresponding "glDelete" methods such as glDeleteTextures to
     * manually delete these lost resources.
