     * Since this method is called at the beginning of rendering, as well as

     * starts, and that need to be recreated when the EGL context is lost.
     * Textures are an example of a resource that you might want to create
     * here.
     * <p/>
     * Note that when the EGL context is lost, all OpenGL resources associated
     * with that context will be automatically deleted. You do not need to call
     * the corresponding "glDelete" methods such as glDeleteTextures to
     * manually delete these lost resources.
